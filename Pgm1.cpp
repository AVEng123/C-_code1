#include<iostream>
// Rules of variable declaration
//1. Name can range from 1 to 255 characters
// 2. Name must begin with a letter or underscore 
//3. After the first initial letter, it can have numbers
//4. It is case sensitive
//5. No space or special characters like $Â£&*
//6. No C++ keyword

   //Even if the execution starts in main function but when the compiler enters the sum function it will find the val variable from global scope 
   // as the local variable is in main which it will not know
   val =78;

   //Here in this case when val is printed the variable will be searched in local scope.

//when compiler finds a variable in a method then it will first try to find the variable in local scope if not found then it will look in global scope not in main
