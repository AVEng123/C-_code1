//OOPs is just an approach.
//as size increases readability maintainability bug-free nature decreases
// works on concept of classes and objects.
// A clas is a template to create objects
//Unless objects are created there is no memory allocated to class
// treats data as a critical for example bank balance
// decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around the objects

/*
Classes - Basic template for creating objects
Objects - Basic run time entities
Data Abstraction(separation of functionality) & Encapsulation - Wrapping data and functions into a single unit. Basically creating a class
Inheritance - Properties of one class can be inherited into others
Polymorphism - ability to take more than one forms
Dynamic Binding - code which will execute is not known until the program runs.
Message Passing - Object.message(Information) call format.
*/

/*
Benefits:
1. Better code reusability using objects and inheritance
2. Principle of data hiding helps build secure systems.
3. Multiple objects can co-exit without any interefence.
4. Software complexity can be easily managed.
